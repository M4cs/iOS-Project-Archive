/// The `HBSupportController` class in `CepheiPrefs` provides a factory that configures a
/// `TSContactViewController` for immediate use. The `TSContactViewController` class, from
/// [TechSupport](https://github.com/ashikase/TechSupport) by ashikase, provides a text box for
/// entering a message, as well as the ability to view or remove pre-defined attachments. After
/// tapping the submit button, the information is provided to the next step, which most commonly is
/// an email composer.
///
/// By providing a link instruction, you can have the message sent to a different email address or
/// posted to a website. You can also provide one or more support instructions, which allow more
/// files to be attached. For more information and for examples of `TSContactViewController` usage,
/// refer to the [demos directory](https://github.com/ashikase/TechSupport/tree/master/Demo) in the
/// TechSupport source.
///
/// A `TSContactViewController` should be pushed on your view controller stack; it should not be 
/// presented modally.

/// package listing (output of `dpkg -l`) and the preferences plist as attachments. To add more,
/// provide an array of `TSIncludeInstruction`s to the `supportInstructions` argument.
