/// UIView (CompactConstraint), a class category from Marco Arment’s
/// [CompactConstraint](https://github.com/marcoarment/CompactConstraint) library, is integrated
/// with Cephei. CompactConstraint provides an Auto Layout grammar and methods that are easier to
/// use and understand than UIKit’s built in functions for programmatically adding constraints.
///
/// Refer to [its readme](https://github.com/marcoarment/CompactConstraint/blob/master/README.md) to
/// learn how to use it. There are two changes to note: most importantly, the methods have an `hb_`
/// prefix, and two methods that are marked as deprecated in the original project have been removed.

/// Add a single constraint with the compact syntax
- (NSLayoutConstraint *)hb_addCompactConstraint:(NSString *)relationship metrics:(NSDictionary <NSString *, NSNumber *> *)metrics views:(NSDictionary <NSString *, UIView *> *)views;

/// Add any number of constraints. Can also mix in Visual Format Language strings.
- (NSArray <NSLayoutConstraint *> *)hb_addCompactConstraints:(NSArray <NSString *> *)relationshipStrings metrics:(NSDictionary <NSString *, NSNumber *> *)metrics views:(NSDictionary <NSString *, UIView *> *)views;

/// And a convenient shortcut for what we always end up doing with the visualFormat call.
