# NoBlur
NoBlur is a substrate extension made for jailbroken devices on iOS 7 through 11

It features system-wide blur with a high level of customization on a per app basis and allows for some individual elements of the SpringBoard to be disabled as well.

NoBlur will remove most (if not all) of the blur on your homescreen and inside of your applications and also will allow for you to change your Tint Alpha (opaqueness of the blur) and Tint Level (Black/White) in order to make the blurs more readable on a per app basis or system wide.

While removing blurs is NoBlur's primary purpose, it also has the side-effect of *greatly* increasing the speed of older devices on modern versions of iOS (like the iPhone 4,4S,5 and the iPad 2).  If you just want a basic, simple, and speedy version of NoBlur then you can use [NoBlur Lite](https://xtm3x.github.io/repo/depics/nblite.html) available on my repo [here](https://xtm3x.github.io/repo).
